                    <p>Hank came to be sometime eight or nine years ago. Her age is unknown since neither her mom nor her previous human knew when she was born. She was found on a farm in a town called “Methland” by author Nick Reding- Oeilwein, Iowa.</p>
                    <p>According to her previous human, “Hank has two siblings,Theodore von Whiskerton and Sophia Fluffbottom. Sophia is a sleek, teeny weenie thing, Theodore is an absolute fluffball, and Hank is the only one built like a truck.”</p>
                    <p>When I asked her previous human why Hank is named “Hank,” they said, “We took them to like two different vets and they both said Hank was a boy. But when we sent her to get fixed, the vet called and said ‘Sorry we couldn’t neuter Hank, she needed to be spayed instead.’”</p>
                    <h2>How old is Hank?</h2>
                    <p>No one knows. Her previous owners estimated she was eight when I got her in 2022. Since she was found as a kitten, her birthdate is unknown, but it is estimated that she was born in April or May. Thus, Hank was lovingly given the birth date of April 20. This makes her a Taurus, which according to her family, is incredibly accurate.</p>
                    <h2>How did I get Hank?</h2>
                    <p>Hank was being bullied by her siblings and her previous humans felt bad about it, so they decided to rehome her. I [only somewhat] jokingly said I would take her. I then decided to drive the 6.5 hours to St. Cloud, MN to make her mine.</p>
