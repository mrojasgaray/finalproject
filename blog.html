                    <p>I woke my human up at 5 am for my wet food. She was in pain from playing Wii bowling, so her mom fed me instead. She’s so much nicer! Until she picked me up, then I remembered I do not like her. I then hid under the bed because I did not want to see her anymore. I came out for food at 12 pm and my best friend was home! We hung out together this afternoon. I watched birds while he watched tv. I ate some food and he still gave me treats. I chose to cuddle with my human on the couch while she took a nap until I got hungry and ate some food. When she woke up, we played with my toy carrot until we got bored. I fell asleep again. It was a good day.</p>

                    <p>I woke up my human at 5 am for my wet food. When I was done, I was cold and I asked for cuddles. My human was already asleep so I slept on her head. She woke up at 9 am and I was still mad at her, so I hid under the bed until noon today. I woke up hungry and asked my human for treats. I did not get any because my human says I am “overweight.” She is so mean! My human gave me kisses instead, which I somewhat enjoyed. I told her I was cold so she turned on the space heater and I laid on the floor right next to it. At 3 pm, I jumped on the bed and started playing with the blanket, until my human came in to play with me. I passed out on the bed, and when I woke up my best friend gave me some treats. It was a good day.</p>

                    <p>I woke up my human at 5 am and she gave me my wet food. I got cold and I was sleepy, so I hid under the bed until 1 pm. When I woke up, I nudged my human in hopes of some treats. Instead, she called me fat and told me to eat my dry food. She’s so mean. I tried acting cute to see if this would work, but she only gave me pets. Then I went back under the bed for some warmth and alone time. When I came out, I got a cat yogurt, played with my human, and passed out on the couch. It was still a good day.</p>

                    <p>Today I woke my human up at 5 am for my wet food. She did not get out of bed until 5:30, but i still got my wet food. I played with her dirty clothes while she had breakfast. I fell asleep in the laundry basket until noon. Then I ate some dry food, watched the squirrels, and fell asleep again. I got cold, so I hid under the bed until 6 pm. Then my best friend came home and and I screamed until he gave me treats. Then I passed out on the couch for a few hours and ate some more food. It was a good day.</p>
