                    <p>Hank came to be sometime eight or nine years ago. Her age is unknown since neither her mom nor her previous owner knew when she was born. She was found on a farm in a town called “Methland” by author Nick Reding- Oeilwein, Iowa. Hank was found with her brother, [name], her sister, [], and her mother, [] when she was just a kitten.</p>

                    <h2>Cat Treats</h2>

                    <p>When they found her, everyone thought she was a boy. This includes two veterinarians. It wasn’t until she was scheduled to get neutered that the vet realized it would not be possible. Instead, Hank got spayed. Her original owners kept her name for unknown reasons. I kept her name because I thought it was funny.</p>
                    <h2>Toys</h2>

                    <p>No one knows. Her previous owners estimated she was eight when I got her in 2022. Since she was found as a kitten, her birthdate is unknown, but it is estimated that she was born in April or May. Thus, Hank was lovingly given the birth date of April 20. This makes her a Taurus, which according to her family, is incredibly accurate.</p>
